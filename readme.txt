*******************************************************

The program compiles and runs functionally.
   
   The program was developed and tested on Clion.  It was 
   compiled, run, and tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt. There
   however is an issue with csegrid running into segmentation
   error after the user enters their guesses. This however is
   not an issue on Clion. The program checks to make sure that
   all locations of a given ship must be hit before the ship is
   sunk.
